This is the extension used to control and use [gmsv_remote](https://github.com/A5R13L/gmsv_remote) on a server.

When the extension is enabled, a `GMod: Remote` button will appear in the status bar. An activity view named `GMod Remote` will also appear which will allow you to search and replace on a server via `gmsv_remote`.
